# Pacloader (5DX+)

This project is an actually forked from Pacloader. The main goal is to run all the SEGA Lindbergh games in Linux and Windows plus, in the future, other Arcade systems such as Namco N2 / ES1 and Raw Thrills.

## Building & Running

### Linux

In order to build the loader in Linux you will need to run the following commands. We recommend Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, but it will run in almost any modern distro using the AppImage.  
Please note other dependencies might be required to run games (see the [guide](docs/guide-linux.md)).


```shell
git clone git@github.com:lindbergh-loader/linuxloader.git
cd linuxloader
./scripts/appimage/install-packages.sh
./scripts/appimage/build-deps.sh
make linux
```

This loader in Linux will need access to the input devices and serial devices on your computer. You should add your user account to the following groups and then _restart your computer_.

```shell
sudo usermod -a -G dialout,input $USER
```

Then you can copy the contents of the build-linux directory to any folder you want and run `./linuxloader -g /path/to/your/game` for the game, or `./linuxloader -g /path/to/your/game -t` for test mode. Please note you might need to set the game executable as "executable" using `chmod +x`.
Or run `./linuxloader --help` to see the available options.

Example:
```shell
cp -a build-linux/* /home/<user>/emulators/linuxloader
cd /home/<user>/emulators/linuxloader
./linuxloader -g /path/to/your/game 
```

### Windows

To build this project in Windows you can use the following script.

```shell
.\scripts\windows\windows-build.bat
```
The script will download Msys, install the required packages and compile the project. After this it will create a .exe file in the build-win32 directory. You can copy this file along with all the required.dll files to any folder you want and run it.


If you'd like to change game settings, you can create a file named `linuxloader.ini` in the same directory as the game executable and copy the default configuration file to it. For example:

```shell
./linuxloader --create config /path/to/your/game-folder
```

Please take a look at the configuration options, supported games and known issues in the [guide](docs/guide-windows.md).


***NOTE*** For configuration files, check the corresponding guide for the operating system you're using: [Linux](docs/guide-linux.md) or [Windows](docs/guide-windows.md).
